###### quotes of the day:
"science expands our ignorance faster than our knowledge. the answer to one question often opens the door to many more. in the same way, the solutions we find today lead to many more problems (climate change for example)"

"problems are the conduit of progress. reject utopia."

"problems are unlimited. problems -> opportunities."

"optimism is a choice. when we are optimistic we can shape the future."
